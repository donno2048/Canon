# Canon

Play canon in d, not in d

This is for python3.8, for other versions you will need to get the corresponding pyaudio.whl

## Install requirements

```
python -m pip install PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl
```

## Run

```
python main.py
```

Then, give it some input, use d for the normal canon
